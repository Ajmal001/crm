            <p>RFM is a popular set of metrics that you can use to evaluate and your customers and quickly identify the best ones. The RFM score consists of three metrics:</p>
            <p><b>R</b>ecency, that evaluates the number of days that passed since the last purchase. The more recent is the purchase, the better.</p>
            <p><b>F</b>requency, that evaluates the number of orders placed by the customer in the last 365 days. The more frequently the customer buys, the better.</p>
            <p><b>M</b>onetary value, that evaluates the total amount of orders placed by the customer in the last 365 days. The more money customer spends, the better.</p>
            <p>To construct these metrics, the entire range of values is divided into a small number of categories, or "buckets." The default number of buckets is 5, and scores for R, F, and M range accordinglyâ€”from 1 (the best score) to 5 (the worst score). You can change the number of buckets and move their boundaries in order to adjust the scores to characteristic values of your business.</p>
            <p>After the metric is applied, every customer gets a three-number set of RFM scores. R1 F1 M1 identifies the best customers, and the higher the scores are, the worse these customers perform in a particular field. You may further re-use these scores in reporting and segmentation.</p>

        recency.tooltip: Recency value is the number of days since the last purchase. Less days means better score, customers with no orders always receive the worst score.
        frequency.tooltip: Frequency value is the number of orders placed by the customer in the last 365 days. More orders means better score.
        monetary.tooltip: Monetary value is the total amount of orders placed by the customer in the last 365 days. Bigger amount means better score.
